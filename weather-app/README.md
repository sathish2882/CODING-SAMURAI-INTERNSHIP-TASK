# 🌦️ Weather App

This is a **Weather Forecast Application** built using **React.js** during my internship at [Coding Samurai](https://www.linkedin.com/company/coding-samurai/).  
It allows users to search for any city and view its 5-day weather forecast with dynamic data fetched from the **OpenWeather API**.
